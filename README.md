# Datasets

**This library provides several public datasets in an organized and easy-to-handle manner.**

The main idea is to be able to use these datasets interactively using the [livebook](https://livebook.com)

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `datasets` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:datasets, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
